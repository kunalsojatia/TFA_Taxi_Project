# Project Objectives: 
#### Extract meaningful insights and produce informative visualizations by leveraging historical data of Uber and Yellow Taxi rides in New York City during a time period of between Jan 2009 and Jun 2015 along with incorporating the local weather data pertaining to those rides. 
# Some of those information are such as but not limited to:

`Insights:` 
1. Hour of the day when it was most popular to take a Yellow Taxi between Jan of 2009 and Jun of 2015
2. Day of the week when it was the most popular to take an Uber between Jan of 2009 and Jun of 2015
3. 95% percentile of distance traveled for all hired trips during July 2013
4. Top 10 days with the highest number of hired rides for 2009 and the average distance for each day
5. 10 days in 2014 were the windiest on average and number of hired trips were made on those days
6. Number of trips were taken each hour hourly precipitation and sustained windspeed NYC received during Hurricane Sandy in NYC (Oct 29-30, 2012) plus the week leading up and the week after (entry for every single hour, even if no rides were taken, no precipitation was measured, or there was no wind)
    

`Visualizations:` 

1. Appropriate visualizations to show for the aforementioned insights
2. Average distance traveled per month for both taxis and Ubers combined with 90% confidence interval 
3. Lat/long coordinate boxes around the three major New York airports: LGA, JFK, and EWR with visualization that compares what day of the week was most popular for drop offs for each airport
4. A heatmap of all hired trips over a map of the area
5. A scatter plot that compares tip amount versus distance for Yellow Taxi rides
6. A scatter plot that compares tip amount versus precipitation amount for Yellow Taxi rides
7. 3 additional insights and one visualization to answer each question
